#DESCRIPTION

**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to design and develop a personal portfolio website that highlights your skills, experience, and projects using modern web technologies. The website must incorporate smooth transitions and advanced animations using libraries such as GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and optionally Three.js for 3D visual effects. The final product should be visually appealing, interactive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

**Technologies and Tools Used**

HTML5 – For creating the structure and layout of the web pages.

CSS3 – For styling the content, including animations, transitions, and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+) – For adding interactivity and controlling animations.

GSAP – To implement smooth and engaging animations like text reveals, fade-ins, scroll-based effects, etc.

Three.js (Optional) – To create stunning 3D visuals or animated backgrounds.

Visual Studio Code – A recommended code editor for writing and managing code.

GitHub / Netlify / Vercel – For hosting and deploying the portfolio online (optional but encouraged).

**Website Structure and Features**

The portfolio should contain the following sections:

Hero Section – A welcoming screen with your name, title, and call-to-action button. Use GSAP to animate text or background elements as the page loads.

About Section – A brief introduction with information about your background, skills, and goals.

Projects Section – Showcase your best work using project cards with hover animations and dynamic reveals.

Contact Section – Include a contact form or social links so visitors can connect with you.

Optional sections may include testimonials, blog posts, or an interactive 3D element powered by Three.js.


**Conclusion**
This project enables you to combine core front-end development skills with advanced animation techniques to build a dynamic and professional portfolio website. By using tools like GSAP and optionally Three.js, you will gain hands-on experience with interactive design and motion, elevating both the aesthetics and user experience. Completing this portfolio not only enhances your web development skills but also provides a polished showcase of your abilities to future employers or collaborators.
